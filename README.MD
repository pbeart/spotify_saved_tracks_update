# Spotify Saved Tracks Update
 
 
## Creates and updates a playlist with your last 50 saved songs.

### Requires the [Spotipy library](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)

## How to use:
- Run `python3 main.py <Spotify username>`
- The script will ask for `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_uri`, all of which can be found with the [Spotify Developer Console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
- A **public** playlist will be created with the last 50 songs to be saved to your library.
